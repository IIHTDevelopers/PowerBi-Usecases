Here are some small hints for handling the missing values:

For SalesData.csv (SalesAmount is missing):
Hint 1: If the missing sale amount seems out of place for that transaction, use the average or median of other sale amounts to fill the gap.
Hint 2: If it's part of a specific region or product category, you can calculate the average SalesAmount for that region/category and fill the missing value.
Hint 3: If the missing value occurs in an insignificant row (based on other fields), it might be safe to simply remove the row.
For ProductData.csv (UnitCost is missing):
Hint 1: Use the average or median UnitCost for products in the same category to estimate the missing value.
Hint 2: If there are similar products in terms of description or type, use their unit cost to fill the gap.
Hint 3: If the product is not crucial to your analysis, consider removing it.
