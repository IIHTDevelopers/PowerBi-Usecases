Task Overview and Hints
1. Data Preparation in Power Query
Perform the following tasks in Power Query to prepare datasets for analysis:

Hints:
Remove Duplicates: Use the "Remove Duplicates" feature in Power Query for all datasets to ensure unique records.
Replace Missing Values: Use the "Fill" or "Replace Values" option to fill missing values in the QualityScore or EfficiencyRating fields (e.g., use average values).
Date Formatting: Format Month, HireDate, and CompletionDate fields as Date data type. Use "Extract Year", "Extract Month", and "Extract Quarter" transformations for time-based analysis.
Data Transformation:
Standardize text to proper case using the "Transform" ribbon.
Convert numeric fields (HoursWorked, EfficiencyRating) to appropriate data types.
2. Analytical Calculations Using DAX
Create DAX measures to analyze performance, resource usage, and training effectiveness.

Hints for DAX Calculations:
Employee Productivity Index:
TasksCompleted / HoursWorked
Monthly Efficiency Score:
AVERAGEX(FILTER(Performance, [Month] = SELECTEDVALUE(Performance[Month])), [EfficiencyRating])
Resource Utilization Rate:
(UsedHours / AllocatedHours) * 100
Total Cost by Department:
SUM(ResourceAllocation[Cost])
Training Success Rate:
(COUNTROWS(FILTER(TrainingData, [CertificationReceived] = "Yes")) / COUNTROWS(TrainingData)) * 100
Training Improvement Index:
AVERAGE(Performance[QualityScore_AfterTraining]) - AVERAGE(Performance[QualityScore_BeforeTraining])
Employee Attrition Prediction:
Use calculated columns to flag employees with low ProductivityIndex and QualityScore.
3. Visualizations in Power BI
Design dashboards and charts for key insights.

Hints for Visualizations:
Employee Performance Dashboard:

Productivity Trends: Use a line chart for Productivity Index trends by month.
Employee Ranking: Create a bar chart sorted by QualityScore or EfficiencyRating.
Departmental Resource Usage:

Resource Utilization Heat Map: Use a heat map with department and resource type.
Cost Analysis: Display a pie chart showing cost percentages by resource type.
Training Effectiveness Analysis:

Training Success Rate: Use a gauge to highlight training success.
Training Impact Chart: Create a scatter plot comparing QualityScore before and after training.
Attrition Risk Map:

Employee Attrition Flags: Use a matrix visualization with department-level filtering.
Risk Factors Analysis: Create cards displaying average ProductivityIndex and QualityScore for flagged employees.
4. Bookmarks and Filters
Enable dynamic reporting and interactivity:

Hints for Dynamic Elements:
Bookmarks:
Create department-specific bookmarks and apply relevant filters to isolate insights.
Filters:
Add slicers for Month, Quarter, and Department to facilitate time-based analysis.
Drill-Through:
Configure drill-through for employee profiles, showing detailed performance, quality, and training data.
